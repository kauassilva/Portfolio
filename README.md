My online resume Web application. The page features a modern and responsive design, with well-organized sections and detailed information about who I am, my technical skills, academic background, extra courses, and personal projects. In addition, the page includes links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/kauassilva) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaua-santos/) profiles. The site is intuitive and easy to navigate with the option to switch to English language if you want to see the content in English.
